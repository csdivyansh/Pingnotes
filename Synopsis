SYNOPSIS
PROJECT-26
Title: Pingnotes
PINGNOTES – A CLOUD-BASED NOTES ORGANIZER USING MERN STACK

Purpose
Education has always thrived on clarity — clear concepts, clear teaching, and clear access to notes. But in today’s fast-paced digital world, students rarely get study material in a way that’s consistent, organized, or secure. Most institutions still depend on scattered WhatsApp groups, lost Google Drive links, and outdated distribution methods. Notes get buried… students miss important files… teachers lose track of what they’ve shared. Chaos everywhere.
PingNotes rises to solve this exact problem.
PingNotes is a modern cloud-based notes organizer built using the powerful MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js). It allows teachers to upload notes in the form of PDFs, images, and documents — all stored securely in Google Drive. Students can access them through auto-generated signed URLs that expire after a controlled duration, ensuring privacy and security.
The system creates a clean, digital bridge between teachers and students. One place for uploading. One place for downloading. No spam, no lost messages, no confusion. Just pure academic flow.


PROBLEM STATEMENT
Educational institutions face significant challenges in distributing study materials:
•	Notes get lost in WhatsApp groups.
•	Google Drive links get leaked or overwritten.
•	There is no subject-wise organization.
•	No clear tracking of files shared by teachers.
•	Students often miss updates due to inconsistent communication.
•	Files stored publicly violate privacy and institutional discipline.
The lack of structure results in wasted time, confusion, and poor academic performance.
Hence, the need is clear: a centralized, role-based, secure platform where notes can be uploaded with discipline and accessed with ease.
PingNotes directly tackles every one of these pain points.



OBJECTIVES OF THE PROJECT

The major objectives behind PingNotes are:
1.	Digitize the academic material-sharing process
2.	Provide secure, role-based access to teachers and students
3.	Store files in a private cloud environment (Google Drive)
4.	Generate temporary signed URLs for controlled access
5.	Prevent unauthorized sharing of educational material
6.	Organize content using Subjects → Topics → Files
7.	Simplify communication between teachers and students
8.	Ensure scalability for institutions of any size
The system aims to combine modern cloud technology with old-school academic discipline.


PROPOSED SYSTEM
The PingNotes system introduces a streamlined, structured, and secure approach:
Key Highlights
•	Teachers upload notes directly → Notes go to Google Drive
•	Files stay private → Only students with signed URLs can access
•	JWT authentication ensures controlled login
•	Multiple user types like Admin, Teacher, Student
•	Organized structure of subjects and nested topics
•	Clean REST API for seamless frontend integration
This system not only modernizes note distribution but also brings transparency and structure.


SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE
PingNotes is built on the MERN stack — a robust combination of modern web technologies.

Frontend – React.js
•	Interactive UI
•	Topic-wise note viewing
•	Student-friendly design

Backend – Node.js + Express.js
•	Handles authentication
•	File processing
•	Request routing
•	Integration with Google Drive API

Database – MongoDB Atlas
Stores:
•	Users (admin/teacher/student)
•	Subjects
•	Topics
•	File metadata

Cloud Storage – Google Drive
•	Files stored securely
•	Private by default
•	Accessed via temporary signed URLs

Authentication – JWT
•	Protects routes
•	Restricts unauthorized access
